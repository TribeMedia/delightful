			<string>Hello guys and girls!

How are you all doing? Itâ€™s been a while since the last update, busy with day job :) Some new things in this update and there are still some cool things I want to add to Delightful.

Anyway, how do you find the app so far? Like it? Hate it? Need improvement? Let me know, please. Reach me on Twitter @nicnocquee or simply reply to TestFlight email.

Cheers,
Nico</string>
